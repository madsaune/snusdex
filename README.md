# snusdex
A project to collect all types of snus into one database. Free to use.

This project has been in my mind for several years. I wanted to create a pokedex for snus, mainly as some kind of social site where people could like or favourite snus and find new types of snus. I dont have the time to develop and maintain such a site so I instead decided to collect every snus and provide it as a free database so others could make such a site.

This is more relevant than ever in Norway where the government has decided to ban all kind of branding on snus so every snus will look the same. Also stores and kiosk selling snus cannot show what they have to their customers. Customers have to know what kind they want before they approach the cashier.

If I decide to use snus, I also want to decide what kind of snus I want to buy and have a look at what the store can offer..
